## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

1. Q: I forgot my password. How do I reset it?

A: Use the "Forgot Password" link on the login screen (if enabled) or sign in with Google as an alternative.

2. Q: Why can't I see my past check-ins?

A: Make sure you're logged into the same account you used earlier. If you recently logged in, wait a few seconds for data to sync, then refresh.

A: Direct editing isn't supported yet. Add a new check-in to reflect changes.

## Data Privacy & Security

- Authentication: Managed via Firebase Authentication (secure tokens).

- Storage: Mood check-ins, appointments, and chat metadata stored in Firestore with userId association.

- Sensitive Data: Only minimal wellness descriptors are stored; no clinical diagnoses are recorded.

- Encryption: Data encrypted at rest and in transit by Firebase infrastructure.

- AI Processing: Recommendations and summaries are generated on demand; no long-term model-side retention of personal content is intended.

- Voice Input: Transcribed locally via browser APIs; only resulting text is used.

- Deletion Policy: Full self-service deletion pending; reach support for interim requests.

- Third Parties: External APIs (videos, articles) are queried without sending your personal identifiers.

## Mobile Experience & Accessibility
