📖 1. STORY OF THE PROJECT

┌─ Background (Before joining the program) ─────────────────────────────────────┐
│                                                                               │
│ Prior to joining the Lenovo LEAP Next Gen Scholar Program, my journey in     │
│ technology was confined to theoretical learning and basic coding exercises.  │
│ While I had completed several academic projects, I lacked the real-world     │
│ experience and industry exposure needed to build meaningful, scalable        │
│ solutions. My understanding of AI was superficial, limited to textbook       │
│ concepts without practical implementation skills.                            │
│                                                                               │
│ I was passionate about technology's potential to solve societal problems     │
│ but struggled to bridge the gap between academic knowledge and practical     │
│ application. The absence of mentorship and structured learning pathways      │
│ made it challenging to transform innovative ideas into impactful products.   │
│                                                                               │

│ Mental health has emerged as one of the most pressing challenges of our      │
│ generation, particularly affecting young professionals, students, and        │
│ working individuals. Key issues identified:                                  │
│                                                                               │
│ • Limited accessibility to mental health resources and professional support │
│ • Lack of affordable, immediate assistance during mental health crises      │
│ • Insufficient tools for continuous mood tracking and self-reflection       │

│ The challenge was to create a comprehensive, technology-driven platform     │
│ that could democratize mental health support while maintaining user privacy │
│ and providing evidence-based interventions.                                 │
│                                                                               │
